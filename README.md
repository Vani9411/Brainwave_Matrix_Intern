Register-app

🚀 Welcome to My DevOps Project – Registration App!
This project is a part of my DevOps learning journey where I developed and deployed a Java-based Registration Web Application. The goal was not just to build the app, but to manage the entire lifecycle using DevOps tools and practices — from development to deployment and monitoring.

🎯 About the Project:
The Registration App allows users to enter and submit their details through a simple, user-friendly form. On the backend, user data is processed and stored in a connected database. More importantly, I implemented complete DevOps integration to handle the automation and deployment of this application.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies I Used:
I used a range of DevOps tools to complete this project:

🐙 Git & GitHub for version control

⚙️ Maven for build automation

🐳 Docker to containerize the application

🚀 Jenkins / GitHub Actions to set up CI/CD pipelines

☁️ AWS EC2 for cloud hosting

🐬 MySQL as the backend database



🔁 How I Managed the Workflow:
I pushed my code to GitHub, then used CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment process. The app was packaged with Maven, containerized using Docker, and deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. This helped me practice real-world DevOps tasks like version control, pipeline creation, and infrastructure automation.

📦 Build & Deploy Process:

Code commit triggers CI/CD 🛠️

Application is built → .war generated

Docker image is created and pushed to Docker Hub

Image is pulled and deployed on EC2 ☁️

I accessed the running app through the public IP 🔗


🌐 Result:
The final deployed app is accessible via a web browser. It stores registration form data and can be extended with features like validation, email verification, and more.

✅ Conclusion:
This project helped me apply my DevOps knowledge in a real-world scenario. From coding and packaging to containerization and cloud deployment — I handled it all. It’s a small app, but a big step in my DevOps career journey! 🚀👩‍💻
